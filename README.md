# langchain-chat-with-pdfs

![Workflow](docs/captura_pantalla.png)

This is a Python application that allows you to load a PDF and ask questions about it using natural language. The application uses a LLM to generate a response about your PDF. The LLM will not answer questions unrelated to the document.

## How it works

If you want to work with only one pdf, please place it in the `one-pdf` directory. This also works for books (with only one pdf). On the other hand, if you have two or more pdfs, your directory will be `multiples-pdfs`. Both work in the same way. 

The applications reads the PDF (or PDFs) and splits the text into smaller chunks that can be then fed into a LLM. It uses OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations of the chunks. The application then finds the chunks that are semantically similar to the question that the user asked and feeds those chunks to the LLM to generate a response.

The applications uses Streamlit to create the GUI and Langchain to deal with the LLM.
